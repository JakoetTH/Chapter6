Project Title: Crystal Air

Background: A relatively old airline would like to switch to a new system
which will improve the overall experience of their passengers.

Description: The current system does not allow passengers to view
flight statuses, ticket prices, dates, availability or flight details.
The goal of this project is to allow passengers to have access to
the above mentioned information and to allow passengers to make
flight ticket purchases.
